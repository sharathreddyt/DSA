# GCD

Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) for given numbers is the highes common factor that divides the numbers evenly.

### For example,

GCD of 15, 12 is 3

#### Process: 

Step 1: List factors of each number

Number | Factors
--- | --- 
15 | 1, 3, 5, 15
12 | 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12

Now based on obeservation, 3 is the only factor that is largest and common for both the numbers. Thats how we calculate GCF on paper.
